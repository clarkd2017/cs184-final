# Final Project: 3D Position Based Fluid Simulation

Team Members: Jason Chang, Kristine Chen, and Dakota Clark

Summary: This project focuses on using particle simulation to create a realistic simulation of rain interacting with a simple flat surface. To do so, we will model particles to act as fluid particles and use knowledge of the physics of water to determine how the particles should move and react to hitting a surface. As a result, the simulation will also model the effects of rain, such as ripples and the formation of puddles.

Problem Description: The simulation of different aspects of nature is important in computer graphics, as it allows one to model the world more realistically. Fluid and water simulation is a large part of this, and has many different applications. Modeling rain is challenging, as it is an effect of nature, and thus varies heavily in many different aspects. Whether it is the size of the rain droplets, the speed and direction of the rain falling, the density and spatial distribution of rain, or the impact of secondary environmental factors such as wind and light, these can all lead to various effects, making rain difficult to model realistically. Once rain hits the surface, this also causes many different effects, such as the formation of small puddles and the resulting rippling of water as rain continues to fall.

Goals and Deliverables:

  Demo: We will be running a non-interactive simulation of rain droplet(s) falling onto a puddle lying on a plane.
